# IntelliJ Defold Debugger (MobDebug)

This plugin adds experimental attach-only debugging support for Defold projects
using the [MobDebug](https://github.com/pkulchenko/MobDebug) protocol. The
implementation is intentionally minimal and focuses on remote debugging of Lua
scripts running in a Defold game.
